CSS3-gallery
============

A gallery made with CSS3 for nice effects. Very simple to implement and use with, for example, a backend system throwing out pictures randomly.

## Installation

All you have to do is take a look at index.html and how the pictures there are formatted. The rest (skewing of pictures randomly and such) is taken care of by the CSS.
